Observations
============
Execution time for pca_small for d = 50, n = 3000 is 0.028 sec where as for d = 3000, n = 100 is 81.753 sec

Bottleneck for our code is the value of d. As the covariance matrix for which we are calculating eigen values is of dimension d*d. Calculation of eigen values takes more time and is the bottleneck.
